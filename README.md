Average computation time of discovery 5 and 6 are close to 70
x = 22 and y = 480 for both
In discovery 5, the algorithm iterates to the end of a list to find a connection
In discovery 6, there is a direct connection
But computation time is the same

Average computation time of discovery 7 and 8 are close to 30
x = 22 and y = 20 for both
7 has the same map with 5
8 has the same map with 6
The computation time is less than 5 and 6 because of the low y value

This shows our algorithm only depends on y
